# Food-Pantry-Management
A program to run all aspects of food pantries from grants and donations, orders, inventory, and distributing food to clients.  To be totally open-source, free for use and modification, and help volunteer organizations running a food pantry to get good analysis of their performance of all processes and report on them.

The program will meet the following requirements:

    Will protect privacy by keeping all data off internet and cloud storage - web interfaces to access from oustide a local network will not be used.  This is less convenient but is critical as client information must be kept absolutely confidential.
    
    Be extremely easy to use, should be self explanatory for a computer illiterate user to operate.  Many volunteers are older with limited if any computer knowledge and this program must allow them to continue to participate by being as simple to use as possible.
  
    Allow for use by pantries that use either the client choice or premade box distribution.
  
    Include bar code reading capability for inventory management if desired.
  
    Permit records keeping in the database itself, eliminating paper records.
  
    Be cross-platform with minimal client involvement in installation.  Java chosen for flexibility and prefer to keep other     languages to a minimum so that less is required to be installed by the client.
  
    Allow for reporting and data analysis reports.  Custom generated reports would be nice for users to be able to create.
  
    
    Be scalable.  Able to run from one computer or from many computers.

    Will include geomapping of addressess for comparison with boundaries of operation to validate client qualification.
    
    Capture signature from a standard signature pad for recording client assertion that they meet TEFAP guidelines.
    
More documentation will be added on the requirements in the wiki when I get a chance.  I work as a medic and am in school for paramedic certification so it may take a bit of time.
